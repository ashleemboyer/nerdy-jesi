      'The Remnant Chronicles',
      'by Mary E. Pearson',
      'Book 1 - The Kiss of Deception',
      'Book 2 - The Heart of Betrayal',
      'Book 3 - The Beauty of Darkness',
      'Synopsis:',
      'Mary E. Pearson\'s young adult series, The Remnant Chronicles, focuses on a princess who\'s determined to change her preordained fate. Born into a highly traditional society, Lia decides to run away from home and an arranged marriage. While on the run, she encounters the prince she was promised to and an assassin who\'s been sent to kill her. The three become bonded as they explore new kingdoms and meet new friends and enemies, all while Lia wrestles with love and her loyalties to her home country and tries to forge her own destiny.',
      'Rating: 5/5',
      'Review:',
      'First, I want to say that I am not being paid or compensated for this review. I purchased these books myself from Amazon and Bookoutlet.com. Everything in this review are my own thoughts and opinions.',
      'A little less than a year ago I was making my first purchase from Bookoutlet.com and this book kept getting recommended to me. The cover was beautiful, and the description was right up my ally. Well I guess I didn\'t pay attention to well because the book ended up being the third in the series. Right after I placed my order to Bookoutlet.com I had cut myself off from buying books for a while to catch up on my TBR pile. So there sat number three of a series on my book shelf. One day I had had enough, and I went onto Amazon and bought the first two books.',
      'I will say this is one of my best book purchases ever! I wish I would have just sucked it up and bought them when I found out my mistake. I could be reading this for a second time not the first time.',
      'I have always had a soft spot for princess stories with a love triangle, but this story is like no other princess love triangle story. The princess, also known as, Lia is about to get married in an arranged marriage and is getting marked for her wedding. The mark represents her kingdom and the kingdom that she is marrying into. The mark turns out to have an important role in her adventures. She is tired of always having her life decided, as princesses usually are, and the one thing she wants most of all is love. Lia decides as she is supposed to be getting married that she can no longer take the pressure of marrying someone she has not met or gotten to know and runs away with Pauline.',
      'We have four different pints of views in this series, but three are most present; Lia\'s, the assassin and the prince. The fourth being Pauline but we do not hear as much from her. I couldn\'t say which I preferred for they all fitted very well with the story and every character had something to say or make us see to realize what is happening. In my opinion I felt the character flows were very well put together and easy to put together. I never found myself struggling to find out what was going on and I really enjoyed that.',
      'As for the love-triangle, I didn\'t find it very over whelming and for once I found myself in the situation where I was actually rooting for both sides. I am usually the type of person to pick one and stick with it. But not this time I found myself picking one side and then reading more and choosing another.',
      'As the series moves on from one book to another you watch Lia grow in the time that she is away from her kingdom and she grows to love and understand others.',
      'The writing was spectacular for all three books. It was so impressive, and I completely fell in love with them. Every sentence or even description was flawless, in my opinion. One thing that I found myself is even though each of these books have over 500 pages I found myself wanting more and never growing tired of a certain topic. This is for sure a series that you should take a journey in. It will not disappoint!!!',
      'Let me know what you think of the book! I would love to know how others feel about this book!',

      'Sadie',
      'By Courtney Summers',
      'Comes out: September 4, 2018',
      'Synopsis:',
      'A gripping novel about the depth of a sister\'s love; poised to be the next book you won\'t be able to stop talking about.',
      'A missing girl on a journey of revenge and a Serial-like podcast following the clues she\'s left behind.',
      'Sadie hasn\'t had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she\'s been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.',
      'But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie\'s entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister\'s killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.',
      'When West McCray—a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America—overhears Sadie\'s story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie\'s journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it\'s too late.',
      'Rating: 4/5',
      'Review:',
      'First, I want to say that I am not being paid or compensated for this review. I was sent this book from Wednesday Books for an honest review. Everything in my review is my own thoughts and opinions.',
      'I knew that this book would be heartbreaking once I read a little about it. I did not know how much it would break me, but boy did it. Sadie was such an incredible book, but all kinds of painful too. This book was so real and honest. Though I am not sure how my heart had survived it. I shall try my hardest to share the reasons why I loved this book.',
      'I very much loved the writing in this book. It is told in two ways. First from the point of view of Sadie and the second is told in a podcast. I have never read a book written this way before and it was awesome! It is very well written. I was so caught up in this story that life just zoomed by without me.',
      'The story begins with an opening of a podcast of “The Girls” by West McCray. The host has no idea what he is getting into when he starts out on his journey on helping find out what happened to a missing girl from a small town. The missing girl is nineteen-year-old Sadie. She has no idea that her story will be becoming a major podcast.',
      'Sadie is out for blood. She is out to find out who murdered her sister. As you start to learn about Sadie and why she is on the adventure, you learn that she has an idea who the killer is, and she will do anything to make sure he is taken care of. Sadie and her sister have had a hard life and losing her sister has affected her and she wants the person to pay for what he did.',
      'So, the reason why I decided to give this book a 4 out of 5 even though I am raving about loving it, is because of the ending. I really would like to know what happens to Sadie. I am not going to go in details because you need to read the story to see how you take the ending, but I find it that I needed a little more detail into what happens. I know that it is probably implied but for myself I would have liked to learn just a little bit more.',
      'This is my first Courtney Summers book and I will be keeping my eye for more of her books. I really enjoyed this story. I have never really been into the podcast thing. I have had young children and it makes it very hard to listen to anything. Now that they are in school and I read this book I feel that maybe I should try out this whole podcast thing. I really enjoyed going back and forth from reading the podcast special and finding out what Sadie is going through.',

      'Baby Teeth',
      'By Zoje Stage',
      'Comes out: July 17, 2018',
      'Synopsis:',
      'Sweetness can be deceptive.',
      'Meet Hanna.',
      'She\'s the sweet-but-silent angel in the adoring eyes of her Daddy. He\'s the only person who understands her, and all Hanna wants is to live happily ever after with him. But Mommy stands in her way, and she\'ll try any trick she can think of to get rid of her. Ideally for good.',
      'Meet Suzette.',
      'She loves her daughter, really, but after years of expulsions and strained home schooling, her precarious health and sanity are weakening day by day. As Hanna\'s tricks become increasingly sophisticated, and Suzette\'s husband remains blind to the failing family dynamics, Suzette starts to fear that there\'s something seriously wrong, and that maybe home isn\'t the best place for their baby girl after all.',
      'My rating: 4/5',
      'Review:',
      'First, I want to say that I am not being paid or compensated for this review. I was sent this book from St. Martin\'s Press for an honest review. Everything in my review is my own thoughts and opinions.',
      'The first thing I am going to say is this book is for sure not for everyone. This story is about a child wanting to kill their mother and that can be something that is really hard to process. It can be an uncomfortable read but if you can get pass that I for sure recommend sitting down and giving this one a try.',
      'WOW! Just wow was this a story that just hit me hard. When I got this book I really had no idea what it was about or who #teamhanna or #teamsuzette was. I could not wait to start the book and find out which one I was. I really caught on from the beginning that I was a #teamsuzette. I have a step daughter and we have had a really rocky relationship and this story really hit hard with me as these situations reminded me of things I went through with her when she was younger. Zoje Stage really makes you think if this is a healthy mother/daughter situation and you really catch on that something needs to be done. This is my first Zoje Stage book that I have read, and I will be continuing to read her books. I just found it very hard to put down that I finished the book in just a couple hours. I sometimes like to take my time with books but with this one there was no taking my time. I had to know what was going to happen. This is for sure a book that everyone needs to read but be very aware that it can be very disturbing. I have always wanted to put down in words the things that I have gone through with my step daughter, but I find that people tend to not believe the things that I went through. It was kind of refreshing to find something that I could relate the situation to. I am not saying my step daughter was anywhere near as bad as Hanna, but it was just different reading where someone didn\'t believe the things you were saying, and it took a horrible situation for people to start believing that the situations that you are explaining are actually happening. My step daughter is now 16 years old and we do not have those kinds of things going on anymore as she has grown older.',
      'So back to the book, Hanna is a young girl that loves her daddy very much, her mother not so much and you can get this picture very early in the book. The story is told from Hanna and Suzette\'s alternating perspectives. There are some terrifying and dysfunctional scenes in this story. Hanna is a very smart little girl, and everyone can see that, but she is mute. She does not talk, and they do not know why. She has a hard time in school and her father sucks it up to her being unable to talk. He doesn\'t not believe his child can have these kinds of issues that everyone is telling him about. Hanna is being homeschooled as she has had issues when her mother has tried to take her to school. Suzette is really pushing for Hanna to be in school as she is not sure she can handle being home with Hanna anymore and she wants to do more of the work she did before Hanna was born. Throughout the book you have such a hard time reading about a child doing the tricks she is doing but you also want to continue to read to find out what happens. So, are you #teamhanna or #teamsuzette? Let me know!',

      'Bring Me Back',
      'By B.A. Paris',
      'Out Now',
      'Synopsis',
      'Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They\'re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.',
      'Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla\'s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there\'s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him…even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.',
      'Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla\'s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen\'s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn\'s trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?',
      'A tour de force of psychological suspense, Bring Me Back will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.',
      'My rating:',
      'Review',
      'First, I want to say that I am not being paid or compensated for this review. I was sent this book from St. Martin\'s Press for an honest review. Everything in my review is my own thoughts and opinions. I have not found a B.A. Paris book that I have not liked and when I received this book out of the blue I was so excited. Her books have some power over me that I end up reading them in one day because I am just unable to put them down. And that is exactly what happen with this book. It has been a while since I could say the book was “unputdownable” but here I am saying it.',
      'Whenever I want to read a book I stay away from reviews until I have read the book, or I have started the book. What I am looking for is to see if others are feeling the same way about the book, either meaning I am enjoying it or it\'s just not happening for me. Well with this book I have still not looked at reviews because I don\'t want anyone ruining how I feel about this one.',
      'This story captured me the moment that I picked it up. I was on my way to my son\'s swim lessons when I got the mail. When I opened the mail and seen I had received this book I put the book I was bringing with me to read back and took this one. When swim lessons where over it was time for me to go home and be a mom with making dinner, but it was so hard to put the book down. Once I was done playing the mom role and my children were in bed I picked this book right back up and stayed up finishing it because I just could not put it down.',
      'Every theory I had about the plot was thrown as I kept going through the story. I was always stuck with my jaw dropping thinking, well then there goes my theory. Half way through the story the author just flipped the script and threw out everything I had thought was going to happen. All I could keep thinking about is where do we go from here. I eventually figured it out, but the story was so good that I had to follow through just to know what happens. This is for sure a book that either you love it or not. There are going to be those readers that just love how this story goes and then there are going to be the ones that just hate it. I was for sure one of those that loved the story and how it turned out. It kept me thinking and I just love that about books.',
      'I want to send out a huge thank you to St. Martin\'s Press and B.A. Paris for this opportunity. I have completely enjoyed reading this story and having it as my first review on my blog.',
